# EduBox – School Management System
This system is an innovative system which allows school management by reducing paperwork, controlling attendance and performance of students, informing parents of their children and ensuring their constant communication. In the novel system, we maintained previous design of class-book which is familiar to teachers so that their daily works are facilitated.  User-friendly interface will help parents, teachers, and students to adapt their new design and features. Edubox mainly helps to save time to fill in the class-books as well as time and power for regular reports.
## Our Mission
Our mission consists of introducing members of various educational bodies with electronic journal and record books, ensuring their control of the quality of the educational services provided, management of system, and establishing simplistic and secure system for management of various documents relating to academic affairs. 
## Availability
The system can be used at places where Internet is available. Elimination of queues for filling up their magazines, facilities of working with the journals for the heads of school at the end of each quarter proves availability of the project. 
## Information
The information is provided for the school administration, teachers, partners and students according to their rights. Changes to the information e.g. table of subjects and other changes instantly appear in the system. Besides, the system shows teachers to fill which journals pertain to the specific classes and need to be completed clearly showing their status which present another advantage of the platform. 
## Statistics
The system features a suite of reporting tools; therefore all reports are automatically calculated and presented with updated results based on present data. Results of reports are updated with dynamic methods and represented in graphics. This advantageous features of the system absolutely removes paperwork. 
## Management
Completion of journals by teachers, and all types of performance of users (as per class, course, specific student or teacher) are shown to the administration. Parents can see the remarks and marks given to their children, and are informed about homework and unattended classes. The users according to their preferences are notified with SMS and electronic mail on various topics. 
Next Step in the Growth of Education
